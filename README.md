# Vouchering Guideline for Freshwater Mollusks
This repository contains notes and protocols for proper vouchering techniques of freshwater mollusks for molecular genetic analyses.

## What is a voucher and why is it important?
- [What is a voucher?](What_is_a_voucher.md#what-is-a-voucher)
- [Why is a voucher important?](What_is_a_voucher.md#why-is-a-voucher-important)
- What information does a voucher required?
- How to fix and preserve a voucher
- Genetic/genomic applications

## Collecting a voucher specimen
- Taking whole animals vs. partial samples (lethal vs. non-lethal)
- Dead animals (fresh dead, shells)
- Number of individuals and consideration of geographic localities
- Various fixing and preservation methods
- Taking partial samples
   - Photo vouchers and recording other biometric characters/measurements
   - Tissue types
      - Tissue biopsy
      - Foot and visceral swab
      - Gonadal fluids
      - Hemolymph
      - Other tissue types
   - How to prevent cross-sample contaminations
   - Fixing media
   - Preservation
- Other environmental samples
   - Water, soil, sediments
