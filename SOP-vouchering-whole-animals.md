# Protocol for vouchering a whole animal
## Materials
- 95 – 100% ethanol (190 – 200 proof), not denatured (but denatured with <5% methanol/isopropanol seems to be ok?)
- Specimen jar
- Collection vials

## What methods is the best euthanizing method?
- Ethanol vs. freezing?
- Cut adductor muscles and place in ethanol? Or freezer/dry ice?
- Pry open and place small objects between the valves and place in ethanol/freezer?

## Procedure
1. Remove dirt and mud from shells 
2. Euthanize
3. (option) cut a small piece of mantle tissues and place in a collection vial with >95% ethanol (see [taking a tissue sample](SOP-taking-tissue-samples.md))
4. Place a whole animal in a specimen jar filled with >95% ethanol. 
5. Change ethanol a few days after the initial preservation.
