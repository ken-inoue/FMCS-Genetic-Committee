# What is a voucher and why is it important?

## What is a voucher?
- A representative sample of an identified taxon that is deposited and stored at a facility from which researchers may later obtain the species for examination and further research.
- A specimen that has been specifically collected and accessioned to support a research project (e.g., ecology, genetics, physiology, distribution). 
- In some cases, a voucher specimen may be collected in the field and then identified later (e.g., DNA barcoding).
-	A voucher typically consists of a whole animal (shells and soft part) or partial tissues (including mucus swabs) especially for rare and imperiled species.


o	A voucher must include an identification label that lists the recognized scientific name, the name of the person who identified the specimen, the collectorâ€™s name, date of collection, habitat of the collection site, locality of the site (preferably consisting of GPS coordinates, with the corresponding datum and degree of accuracy), and a collection number assigned by the collector. The specimen may also include annotations indicating taxonomic changes made by later research.
o	The voucher specimen should be deposited in an official museum or research facility.
