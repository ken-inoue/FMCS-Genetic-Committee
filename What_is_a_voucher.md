# What is a voucher and why is it important?

## What is a voucher?
-	A representative specimen that has been specifically collected and accessioned to support a research/conservation project (genetic analysis, distributional and status surveys, biodiversity assessment)
-	A voucher specimen may be collected in the field and then identified later (e.g., DNA barcoding)
-	A voucher may be collected alive or dead animal
-	A voucher consists of a whole animal (shells and soft part), partial tissues of an animal (mantle tissue clip, mucus swab), or in some cases, other forms (DNA/RNA solutions, histological specimen)
-	A voucher is deposited and stored at a facility from which researchers may later use the specimen for further study
